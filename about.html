            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Founded in 2010, The Kings Menu began as a small family-owned restaurant with a passion for creating exceptional dining experiences. What started as a humble kitchen with just five tables has grown into one of the most beloved dining destinations in the city.</p>
            <p>Our commitment to quality ingredients, innovative recipes, and outstanding service has remained unchanged throughout our journey. We take pride in our farm-to-table approach, working directly with local farmers and producers to bring you the freshest flavors.</p>
            <p>The Kings Menu is more than just a restaurant - it's a place where memories are made, where every meal is an occasion, and where our guests become part of our extended family.</p>
